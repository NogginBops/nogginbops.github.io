Hello! My name is Julius HÃ¤ger and I'm a Swedish graphics programmer.

I'm the current maintainer of [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk), a platform abstraction layer and OpenGL bindings for C#, and this is my work.

# [OpenTK](http://github.com/opentk/opentk) maintainer

OpenTK provides OpenGL bindings and window creation and management for C#, and has over 3.5 million downloads on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/).

I've been maintainer for OpenTK since November 2020. 
During that time we've worked hard on our new OpenGL bindings generator and platform abstraction layer targeting Win32, Linux, and macos.

# [Two New Methods for Real-Time Ptex](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1701157/FULLTEXT01.pdf)

In 2022 me and Hugo Dettner presented two new methods for efficiently rendering and filtering ptex on the GPU in real-time as part of our Batchelor's thesis. One of our presented methods outperformed previous work while having quality matching previous state of the art.

# Real-time GPU path tracer

I made a small real-time GPU path tracer for the course DH2323 at KTH. 
It's written in C# using OpenTK, and has BVH acceleration.

# Game engine using OpenTK/C#

A "from scratch" game engine written with OpenTK. It features a PBR render pipeline, cascaded shadow maps, frustum culling, and integrated physics using [BepuPhysics2](https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2). The engine also contains nice to have features such as live shader reloading.

Metro vision was made during the 2020 GMTK Game Jam where I and a team of 8 other people made a innovative puzzler where your line of sight determines what controls/actions are available at your displosal.
